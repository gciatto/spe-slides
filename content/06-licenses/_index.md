# What is a license

**A legal instrument used to regulate access, use, and redistribution of software**

* You generally want to retain some guarantees on the software, e.g.:
    * be recognized as the *original creator*;
    * decide whether or not someone else can *redistribute* it
    * decide under which circumstances the software can be *used*
    * *get paid* if others use it
* Law can change greatly among countries
    * If you are not a lawyer, or you can’t pay a lawyer, **don’t come up with your own license**
    * A custom license is likely to be in *conflict* with the law of some countries
    * Better choosing something *proven to work*

---

# Copyright vs. Copyleft

### Copyright

**Legal right** that *grants the creator* of an original work *exclusive* rights for its *use* and *(re)distribution*

### Copyleft

**Practice** (*not a legal right!*) in which *the creators surrenders some, but not all, rights* under copyright law.
* *Strong*: all derived works inherit the copyleft license
* *Weak*: some derived work may not inherit it
* *Full*: all the parts of the work are distributed under the terms of the copyleft license
* *Partial*: only some parts are covered by the copyleft license.

---

# Ownership vs. Licensing

### Ownership

**Possession** of a copy of software.

The possession *implies right to use*, even if such use implies a violation of the license (e.g. for making changes to the software, or making incidental copies).

### Licensing

The software is not sold, but merely “licensed”, namely **permitted to be used**, *under the conditions of a End-user license agreement* (EULA).

---

## Proprietary vs. Free

{{<image src="rights.svg">}}

#### Proprietary

The software publisher grants the right to use *a certain number of copies under the conditions of an EULA*, but **does not transfer ownership** of the copies to the customer.
Usage of the software may be subjected to acceptance of the EULA.

#### Free

The software publisher grants *extensive rights to modify and redistribute* the software, often prohibiting rolling back such rights (strong copyleft).

## Freedom: as in beer vs. as in speech

Much easier for italian speakers:
* free as in speech: *libero*
* free as in beer: *gratuito*

### Free as in beer

*Free of charge*

### Free as in speech

The user receives the *source code* of the software, is allowed to *modify* and *redistribute* it.
* The user can be asked to *pay for receiving a copy*: it can be distributed behind a fee
* The author can also ask for *additional money for accessing the source code*
    * but not "too much"
    * e.g., asking for a billion dollars would make the software de-facto proprietary.

---

# Free vs. Open source

Usually together, but:
* **Open source**: focus on availability of *source code* and right to modify and share it
* **Free**: focus on freedom to use the *program*, modify, and share it

There are non-free open source licenses:
* Apple Public source license 1.0 $\Rightarrow$ [too generic](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#apsl1)
* Artistic License 1.0 $\Rightarrow$ overly vague
* Nasa Open Source Agreement

And there are free non-open source licenses as well
* WTFPL $\Rightarrow$ ["public domain" is undefined in EU legislation](https://opensource.org/minutes20090304)
* Netscape public license
* OpenSSL license

---

# Unlicensed software

* **Internal business and trade secrets**
    * Release is unwanted
    * Undisclosed, unavailable, unlicensed
* **Software distributed without any license**
    * *fully copyright protected*, and therefore **legally unusable**
* **Public domain**
    * At copyright termination, distributed unlicensed software becomes public domain: freely usable, modifiable, redistributable
    * It takes over 100 years for software released after 2008

---

## Proprietary licenses' constraints

* **Closed volume**: the customer commits to purchase *a certain number of licenses over a fixed period* (mostly two years).
    * Licensing can be limited per user, CPU, concurrent usage, etc.
* **Maintenance and support**: proprietary licenses usually include forms of maintenance and support
* **Warranty**: proprietary licenses often include a warranty
    * Typically time limited
    * Typically with purcheasable extensions

---

## GNU GPLv3

**GNU General Public License**
* *Free and open source*
* *Strong copyleft*: derived work must be released under a compatible license
* *Does not allow linking* from non GPL-compatible licensed software!
    * If you want your software to be used as a dependency of proprietary software, don’t use this license!


---

## GNU LGPLv3

**GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)**
* A modification of the GPLv3 with a *linking exception*
    * Not an entirely different license as the previous LGPL
* *Free and open source*
* *Strong copyleft*: derived work must be released under a compatible license
* *Allows linking* from code with a different license
* *Work linking* the LGPL library (combined work) *must*:
    * *Allow modification of the original linked library* shipped with the work
    * **Allow reverse engineering** and debugging of the combined work
* These requirements are *often unacceptable for companies*!

---

## GNU GPL with linking exception

**GNU General Public License with linking exception**
* Can be *built on top of a GPL*, by manually adding an exception for linking
* *Free and open source*
* *Strong copyleft*: derived work must be released under a compatible license
* Allows linking from code with a different license without further restrictions
    * Combined work can be redistributed under non GPL-compatible licenses

**Example exception**

```plain
Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on this library.
Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this library with
independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to
copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a module which
is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your
version of the library, but you are not obliged to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
statement from your version.
```

## MIT License

* **Extremely permissive**
* *Free and open source*
* *GPL compatible*
* *No copyleft*: the work or a derivative can be redistributed under any other license
* Does not protect trademarks
* Does not protect patent claims

---

## Apache License 2.0

* *More restrictive than MIT*
* *Free and open source*
* *GPL compatible*
* *No copyleft*: the work or a derivative can be redistributed under any other license
* Protects trademarks
* Allows for placing a warranty
* Protects patent claims
* Forces authors of derived works to *state significant changes* made to the software
* If a `NOTICE` file with authors is provided, it must be included when redistributed. Entries can be appended.

---

## WTFPL

* Extremely permissive but *problematic*
* A good example of how things may go wrong if you write licenses without competence
* Free, *not open source*
* *No copyleft*
* Better use something else

```plain
           DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE

# Applying a License

1. Create a `LICENSE` or `COPYING` plain text file in the repository with the *full license* text
    * Full text can be easy found online
    * *Change the owner and the copyright year*
2. Apply a **copyright notice header** to *every source file*
    * Use an automated tool to do it 
    * Most IDEs can deal with this
    * Header templates are usually available where the license is published

**Your software is now licensed!**
